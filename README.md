## Development Methodologies
We used the following methodologies to organize and streamline our development process:

### Kanban: 
For team organization and task management.
### Pair Programming: 
For collaborative coding and problem-solving.
### Design Process
We began by creating low-fidelity wireframes and a design prototype using Figma:

#### Low-Fidelity Wireframes: 
Initial sketches and layouts to plan the structure and user flow.
#### Figma Prototype: 
Detailed design prototype to visualize the final look and feel of the application.
